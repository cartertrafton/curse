	- Class structure into user, student, instructor, and admin
	- Database separation into student, instructor, admin, and courses
	  tables with instructor and courses table connected
	- Multiple menu interfaces for each set of class functions

3. Implementation and unit testing
	- Code the software units and test individually
	- Test database with queries
	- Test classes with hardcoded objects and calling of functions for each class
	- Test GUI menu with basic functions

4. Integration
	- Merge database, class, and GUI units
	- Test for database and class connection
	- Integrate and test the GUI with the class functions
	- QA test for outlier end-cases and add error reporting

5. Operation and maintenance
	- Bug fix from overall integration
	- Full release of the software
	- Push updates when needed
